- Use MySQL and teh Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
- Be deployed using Heroku (with data).
- Use at leat one new library, package, or technology that we haven't discussed.
- Have a polished UI.
- Be responsive.
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
- Have a foler structure that meets the MVC paradigm.
- Include authentication (express-session and cookies).
- Protect API kes and sensitive information with environment variables.
- have a clean repository that meets qualit coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best praactices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
